  <ECAG_EnableLordPatches>Enable lord job patches</ECAG_EnableLordPatches>
  <ECAG_EnableLordPatches_desc>This enables patches to the caravan forming lord job, which allows this mod to add the following three buttons.</ECAG_EnableLordPatches_desc>

  <ECAG_EnableSetHitchingSpotButton>Enable "Set hitching spot" button</ECAG_EnableSetHitchingSpotButton>
  <ECAG_EnableSetCaravanExitButton>Enable "Set caravan exit" button</ECAG_EnableSetCaravanExitButton>
  <ECAG_EnableCaravanGoButton>Enable "Caravan go!" button</ECAG_EnableCaravanGoButton>
  
  <ECAG_EnableLoadOnCaravanFix>Enable "load on caravan" fix</ECAG_EnableLoadOnCaravanFix>
  <ECAG_EnableLoadOnCaravanFix_desc>This enables a fix for the "load x onto caravan" function: When the caravan has pack animals assigned, the colonists will only load items onto the animals through the "load onto caravan" function, not onto the colonist themselves. This fix will also load things onto the colonist once the pack animal with the most free space has less than 2 weight units left.</ECAG_EnableLoadOnCaravanFix_desc>
  
  <ECAG_EnableGatherDownedPawnsFixes>Enable downed pawn fixes</ECAG_EnableGatherDownedPawnsFixes>
  <ECAG_EnableGatherDownedPawnsFixes_desc>This will enable two fixes for taking downed colonists onto a caravan. The game sometimes "forgets" to take a downed colonist on a caravan, because they are placed too far away from the exit spot. The base game will also throw errors when you carry a downed pawn manually that belongs to a caravan. With this fix you can carry them to the exit spot manually.</ECAG_EnableGatherDownedPawnsFixes_desc>
  
  <ECAG_DisableForceCaravanDepartureButton>Disable game version 1.6's "Force caravan departure" button</ECAG_DisableForceCaravanDepartureButton>
  <ECAG_DisableForceCaravanDepartureButton_desc>Disables the original "Force caravan departure" button which was added in game version 1.6. Use this option if you don't want that button because this mod's "Caravan go!" button does the same thing, but better: It will take your caravan animals and the decision is not final.</ECAG_DisableForceCaravanDepartureButton_desc>
  
  <ECAG_GameRestartRequired>You need to restart Rimworld for the changes to take effect.</ECAG_GameRestartRequired> 
  <ECAG_MakeSureNoCarvanIsForming>Make sure that no caravan is forming in your savegame!</ECAG_MakeSureNoCarvanIsForming>
